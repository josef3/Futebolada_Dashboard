# Dashboard Futeb⚽lada

As part of the Futeb⚽lada project 
(Backend: https://github.com/josef3/Futebolada_Backend_v2, 
Frontend: https://github.com/josef3/Futebolada_Next) 
I've created a dashboard to get able to do admin tasks in any device, 
opposed to what happened before, when I needed an external application to do API calls (like Postman) 
or eventually the database admin tool to do commands directly in the DB (like PGAdmin).

## General Info ℹ️ 

Me and my friends usually go play football every weekend and I've come with an idea for us to be able to see our individual performance and progress weekend after weekend.\
So, I've decided to put my last months of learning into practise and produce a system to manage the player's stats 📈. (The games are recorded and then analyzed 🎥).

This was a really important and rewarding challenge for me, 
as my friends and I are using something I created from scratch. 
And their constant feedback makes me motivated to improve the application everyday 💪.

We also have some features in mind that I hope to be live soon 👀.
